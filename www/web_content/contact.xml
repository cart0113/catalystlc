    <div class="h1">Get Involved!</div>
    Currently, this project is primarily a volunteer effort. Our vision 
    includes growing our volunteer corps & possibly hiring "pre-career"
    tutors so that we can expand to other libraries and help more students.  
    As a young organization, we're looking for lots of help. If you want to 
    get involved as a tutor or a charitable donor, please contact us for 
    more information. 

    <br/><br/>
    <div class="h1 hs">Financial Donations</div>

    time right now to tutor? Make a tax deductible donation today!

    Catalyst is a registered 501(c)(3) with the Internal Revenue Service.
